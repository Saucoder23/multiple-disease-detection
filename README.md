# ðŸ©º Multiple Disease Detection System using Machine Learning

This project is a **web-based application** that helps users detect the likelihood of **Diabetes** and **Heart Disease** using simple health metrics and Machine Learning models.

Built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Scikit-learn**, this app allows users to input basic health information and receive a real-time prediction based on trained models.

## ðŸ§  Features

- âœ… Diabetes prediction using PIMA Indian dataset
- âœ… Heart disease prediction using UCI Heart dataset
- âœ… Streamlit web UI with clean sidebar navigation
- âœ… Lightweight and runs locally

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Trained ML models are saved as `.sav` files using `pickle`
- Streamlit UI collects user input
- Input is passed to ML models
- Results are displayed instantly

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Streamlit Option Menu
- Pandas, NumPy
